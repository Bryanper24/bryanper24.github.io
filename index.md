### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2 was a favorite because I never knew how blackjack worked. It showed me how to calculate the values of each different card. It was a bit frustrating at first not being able to get the Ace card to equal 1 but after some trial and error I got it with the help of my partner. 

* Lab 10 
    Lab 10, part 2 was a favortite because I learned how to match the population of each different country to their respective country. It was funny because me and my partner had forgoten to add the argrument line and we were wondering why nothing was working. Once we realized it was good learning to not looking over the needs of the code to try and finish faster. 

* Lab 11
    Lab 11, part 2 was a favorite because it showed me how to use multiple Bool's and Int's consecutively. I learned why each one had importance and even missing just one lowercase j can mess everything up. It showed me to be more attentive to detail.
